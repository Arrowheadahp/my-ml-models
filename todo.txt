Here is a new Preprocessing pipeline that must be implemented:

0. Concatenate the train and test dataset but without the y value.

1. first thing to do is to one hot encode every object features and the features that have discrret values (may be number of unique <= 12)

2. Scale the whole dataset. use powertransformer() to do this or standardscaler().

3. for every feature that have >0 number of null values: make a column to indicate the which datapoint has null value like x_is_null feature.

4. use an imputer KNNImputer preferred

5. Use a KNNregressor to try to classify train datapoint from test datapoint. Use the predictions of the regressor to find the train datapoints that most resembles the test datapoints
	Plop the top 25% into Validation dataset
	
5.5 You can check for unwanted or duplicate columns or you can pass that burden to the next step
	
6. Use RFECV to get the features most important to predicting y. Use only train data (not val data) for this and from now on. Use LGBM for this.

7. reduce all the datasets to include only the features that we get from RFECV.

wallah... we have a scaled dataset that has no null values and good val and test dataset as well.
